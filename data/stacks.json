A lot is still in Php.\r\n- Tumblr runs in one colocation site. Designs are keeping geographical distribution in mind for the future.\r\n- Two components to Tumblr as a platform: public Tumblelogs and Dashboard\r\n- Public Tumblelog is what the public deals with in terms of a blog. Easy to cache as its not that dynamic.\r\n- Dashboard is similar to the Twitter timeline. Users follow real-time updates from all the users they follow.\r\n- iOS app used to use a web view with zepto.js and [GRMoustache](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache) but is not native.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2012 -\r\n\r\n- 500 million page views a day\r\n- 15B+ page views month\r\n- ~20 engineers\r\n- Peak rate of ~40k requests per second\r\n- 1+ TB/day into Hadoop cluster\r\n- Many TB/day into MySQL/HBase/Redis/Memcache\r\n- Growing at 30% a month\r\n- ~1000 hardware nodes in production\r\n- Billions of page visits per month per engineer\r\n- Posts are about 50GB a day.

Adding complexity to overcome scalability challenges may work in the short run, but will eventually catch up with you.\r\n- Degrade, not fail. It's advisable to have your proxies monitor their own ability to reach their backends. \r\n- Put a lot of time and effort and tooling into MySQL sharding. MongoDB is not used even though it is popular in NY (their location). MySQL can scale just fine.\r\n- Node.js wasn\u2019t selected because it is easier to scale the team with a JVM base. Node.js isn\u2019t developed enough to have standards and best practices, a large volume of well tested code. With Scala you can use all the Java code. \r\n- The simplest iteration to outgrowing a single varnish node is static partitioning. This involves determining your unique identifier, and to split this space between two varnish nodes.\r\n- Process is roughly Scrum like. Lightweight. \r\n- Every developer has a preconfigured development machine. It gets updates via Puppet. \r\n- Dev machines can roll changes, test, then roll out to staging, and then roll out to production.\r\n- On the service side they\u2019ve implemented a testing infrastructure with commit hooks, Jenkins, and continuous integration and build notifications.
